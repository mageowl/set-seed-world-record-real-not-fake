# Fake minecraft speedrun datapack
Install this datapack, as well as [Blooming Biosphere](https://modrinth.com/datapack/blooming-biosphere) by hhumanoid and [Tectonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tectonic) by Apollo. I reccommend using a mod to install these datapacks globally. Make sure to also install the resourcepack located in ./resourcepack

## Category rules:
- You have to use the seed found in seed.txt
- You must spend at least 20 seconds reading _Romeo and Juliet_.
- You have to watch all of "How to build a Nether Portal FAST" by Sam Dao on YT. For conviencience, the video is easly accessable by running `/trigger howtobuildaportal`.
- To finish the run, you must obtain the "Run Validated" achievement.
